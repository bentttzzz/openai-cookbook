{"prompt": "Write a follow-up email responding to a client’s concern about shipping costs. Explain our cost-saving shipping options, such as combining sea and express shipping. Use a reassuring and informative tone, and end with a call to action for the next steps.", "completion": "Subject: Cost-Effective Shipping Options for Your Order\n\nHi [Recipient’s Name],\n\nI understand your concern about the shipping cost from China, which is typically higher than domestic shipping in the US. However, our prices are significantly lower.\n\nI recall you mentioned needing 3,000 T-shirts for October. For this quantity, we usually recommend shipping by sea to save on costs.\n\nConsidering that some sizes or details might be finalized later, many of our clients split the order: shipping 2,500 T-shirts by sea and placing a separate order for the remaining 500 T-shirts to be shipped by express courier.\n\nThis combination method offers both cost savings and flexibility, making it an optimal choice for your consideration.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,\nRyan\n"}
